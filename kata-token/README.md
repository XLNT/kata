### Hello __________,

You have been formally invited to join theCyber, a decentralized club on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract (thecyber.eth | 0x97A99C819544AD0617F48379840941eFbe1bfAE1) is straightforward by design and deliberately avoids equity memberships, dues, contract ownership or migration, and voting or other governance. Rather, theCyber is intended to operate as a testbed that its members can use to communicate, attend events, and collaborate.

The first goal of theCyber is to establish a diverse set of knowledgeable members without requiring identity verification. To facilitate this goal, a gatekeeper contract (gatekeeper.thecyber.eth | 0x44919b8026f38D70437A8eB3BE47B06aB1c3E4Bf) has been set up to accept submissions. Each of these submissions will require one of 300 unique passphrases, and the gatekeeper will accept the first 250 entrants that successfully submit an address.

You have been provided with ten of these passphrases. Feel free to use or share them as you see fit. Should you decide not to join theCyber or share the passphrases, no action is required; duplicate passphrases have been provided to other applicants and unused passphrases will eventually be made public. Should you decide to register with the gatekeeper, be advised that there is no pre-commit scheme and that rejected or pending transactions will make the passphrase publicly visible.

Your ten passphrases:
  concern triangle interface asset
  pension bargain skeleton service
  genuine talented chalk guerrilla
  colleague photocopy raise devote
  respect challenge galaxy rainbow
  general revenge pension variable
  reproduce related recover screen
  recommend witness attitude trace
  conscious nominate behave tactic
  concept formation devote pasture

By joining theCyber, you're participating in an experiment that, without putting any funds at risk, will refine best practices for creating decentralized clubs that are safe and fair to all involved. Each member of theCyber, externally owned accounts and contracts alike, should play by the same set of rules and enjoy the same privileges. We all believe in the mission of using blockchain technology to build a more transparent, open, and inclusive future. The same motivations underpin the need to reform and improve institutions that are exclusive and opaque by design.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
